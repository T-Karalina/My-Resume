<h1>My hobbies</h1>
<p>My hobbies are reading books and working out. Along with this, I also like cooking.I love learning new skills and recently I have been interested in learning different languages as they help me explore
new cultures around the world. I started taking French classes and already cleared the beginner level. Besides, one of my favourite hobbies is travelling because I am fond of discovering new cities and places around the world. I love friendsâ€™ trips and family outings but solo travelling brings me the real
adventure and thrill to venture into new places all by myself.</p>
